# Animation Playground

It's a fun little project of mine where i experimented with CSS animations.

## Developing

1. Step: `npm install`

2. Start in developer mode:
```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

<!-- > To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment. -->
